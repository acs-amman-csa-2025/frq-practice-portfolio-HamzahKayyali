## Problem statement and definition

Program Description:  Data has been recorded in an external file for each student in a computer science class in the form of three numbers:  class, letter grade and gender.  The following numeric codes are used in the file:

The data for each student is on a separate line in the file.  The last student record will be all zero’s which will not be processed.  Find the number of students in each class and print a summary as shown below.  Since the letter grade and sex code for the student is not used by this program it may be ignored.

## Things I did or review to prepare for this problem

I did not really review anything for this I just started doing it.

## Problems I faced doing this problem

A problem I faced is how to count the number of people in each class because there was also the grade and the gender that you had to skip.

## Things I learned doing this problem

I learned how to use the nextInt method better, I just used nextInt twice to skip the grades and the gender.
